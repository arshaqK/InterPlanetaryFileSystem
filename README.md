# InterPlanetaryFileSystem

The primary goal of this project centered on the Interplanetary File System (IPFS),with a focus on file-sharing features. One of the main features of IPFS is that, instead of using traditional filenames, files are uniquely identifiable and accessible by their content hash. In addition, the project intends to tackle the difficult problem of data management in a distributed context, requiring the implementation of DHT.
